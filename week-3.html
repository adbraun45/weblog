            <h2>Work this week</h2>
            <p>Attended two team meetings.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Computer rooms at the ACF need to be unlocked every morning and locked every evening. This week I learned how to open and close site.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Aside from the main entrance to the ACF all doors leaving the building are alarmed. Many people who work on site are contractors and they sometimes need these doors open. When that is the caes I need to go and turn them off temporaily.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of the hardware in one of the computer rooms was going out of warranty and the serial numbers were needed. I was involved in going to these server racks and recording the serial numbers for various models of servers and switches.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All non-staff workers at the ACF require a vistor pass to access secure areas they might need access to. I learned the process of issuing vistors with these passes. First they sign in as a visitor on I you then enable the pass for use that day, set the access permission and assign the card number to that person on the sign-in system.</p>
